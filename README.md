#Classifying Activity Type from Strava Data
Strava is an application that allows users to track data on their exercises and record them for things such as sharing with friends, recording progress, or looking at weekly, monthly, or yearly stats. The data Strava data includes things such as maximum speed, distance traveled, moving time, and elevation gain. And the activities to be predicted are things like running, biking, and swimming.

Here I am going to classify what type of activity a recorded activity was based on its data. I will be using a Neural Network Classifier based on asignment A4 https://nbviewer.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs445/notebooks/A4.2%20Classification%20of%20Hand-Drawn%20Digits.ipynb

The data I will be using is a combination of data from a user on Kaggle found bellow as well as my own strava data.
